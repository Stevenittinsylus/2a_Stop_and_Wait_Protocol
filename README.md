# 2a_Stop_and_Wait_Protocol
## AIM 
To write a python program to perform stop and wait protocol
## ALGORITHM
1. Start the program.
2. Get the frame size from the user
3. To create the frame based on the user request.
4. To send frames to server from the client side.
5. If your frames reach the server it will send ACK signal to client
6. Stop the Program
## PROGRAM
client.py
```
import socket
c = socket.socket()
c.connect(('localhost', 8000))

while True:
    ip = input("Enter IP address to find MAC (or type 'exit' to quit): ")

    if ip.lower() == "exit":  
        break

    c.send(ip.encode())
    mac = c.recv(1024).decode()
    print(f"MAC Address for {ip}: {mac}")
c.close()


```
server.py
```
import socket
s = socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost', 8000))
s.listen(5)
print("Server is listening...")

c, addr = s.accept()
print(f"Connection established with {addr}")

address = {
    "165.165.80.80": "6A:08:AA:C2",
    "165.165.79.1": "8A:BC:E3:FA"
}

while True:
    ip = c.recv(1024).decode()

    if not ip:  
        break

    try:
        mac = address[ip]  # Get the MAC address for the IP
        print(f"IP: {ip} -> MAC: {mac}")
        c.send(mac.encode())  
    except KeyError:
        print(f"IP: {ip} not found in ARP table.")
        c.send("Not Found".encode())
c.close()
s.close()
```
